## Overview

**Project Title**: Console Checkers Game

**Project Description**: This is a simple two-player checkers game implemented in C++. It uses a console-based interface and simulates traditional American checkers rules.

**Project Goals**: Develop a playable, turn-based checkers game in a console environment.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Clone or download this project to your local machine.
2. Push the start play button.

Instructions for using the software:

1. The game will alternate turns between red and black.
2. Input moves in the format: start_row start_col end_row end_col (e.g., 2 3 3 4).
3. The game automatically detects valid moves and captures. It promotes pieces to kings when reaching the opposite end of the board.
4. The game ends when a player has no valid moves left.
